# 100 Objects

My goal here, as many other’s probably was, was to create a narrative using my list of objects that I found represented me. As someone pursuing a career in graphic design, I find myself spending many hours on my computer. My computer executes my work, my concepts, my ideas. It’s products represent me to a certain extent. This book is a play on our relationship with our computers, extensions of ourselves. 

In this book, my laptop writes the narrative. By inputting my list into a formula that randomizes the order of my list, the words are given a new meaning, and become a rewritten short story every time the page is refreshed. An outsider’s perspective of ones self is often created based on one’s uploads, the output of a computer.

I chose to create a book as a way of keeping the intimacy of reading a story in a hand held book. While the formal execution is tactile and personal, the content is nonsensical and impersonal, which is often a result of online personas and communication. The line work on the cover and middle spread is a tracing of the form of the shape made by the original list, merging something done my hand with something presented on a computer screen. 

Displayed below is my process, followed by a link the the PDF of the book. Above are links to downloads of images of the physical book aswell.
